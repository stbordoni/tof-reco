JUST NOTES WHILE DEVELOPING THE CODE
- improve handling of errors
- consider options whena a board is missing
- post trig!
- add firmware to saved info
- fix intthrthr
 - add variabel total Hits
- add warning when oerlapping with baseline when doing fit

- change hitedge to min and max

- dictionary of errors

- int to say how many edges

- add getters for 

- later, change TofRun to TofGate or smth
set private

- goodness of fit if new fgit position is within 5 DataSamples  

hitfirquality

constructor for this_hit_time

integral vs maxt

tot vs integral  

if discrepancy was too big in fit

create method for CF and set deafult value

HitFitFunction

method to create hist from vector

method create histogram

signal get position in bar and absolute nd280 position of the bar, not signal 

change cosntructor of TofSignal to have 2 or 1 tofhit

pos reco with amplitudes

double getTime using average of left and right and with correction

double get time from ext coordinate of TPC

signal is 1,2,3 

data segment

update baseline after fit? 

make quality check a bool?
